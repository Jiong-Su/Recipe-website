            Bakewell Tart!
        </title>
        <p class="recipefont">A classic dessert we all know and love – homemade shortcrust pastry, jam, frangipane, almonds… a Bakewell tart!  </p>
        <div class="center">

        <p class="recipefont">We all love a classic bake right?! Well, today’s new post is 100% one of the most classic bakes you can ever bake or even consume… a Bakewell tart. I LOVE the Bakewell flavour, and I have some delicious Bakewell bakes on my blog, but this is just the best.  </p>
        <p class="recipefont">Straight away I will admit that when I was younger (and I am talking about when I was about 10 years old) I used to think Bakewell was super icky and disgusting because it wasn’t chocolatey, and I had convinced myself that I hated almonds – needless to say, I was just being an utter fusspot. </p>
        <div class="center">

        <div class="center">

        </div>
        <p class="recipefont">
            For those of you who don’t know… A Bakewell tart is a typically English pudding which consists of a shortcrust pastry case with layers of jam, frangipane, and a topping of flaked almonds – and it is just wonderful. 
        </p>
        <p class="recipefont">
            I had one of these on my blog years and years ago but through the years of transferring my blog data over and over it all got a bit blah, so I decided to post a new recipe for this beauty – and it is 100% worth the wait and all the many requests from you guys. 
        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img class="recipeimage" src="image/Tart/BakewellTart3-2.jpg" >
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <img class="recipeimage" src="image/Tart/BakewellTart2-2.jpg" >
        </div>
        <p class="recipefont">I like to make my own shortcrust pastry, and it’s so much easier to make than you think. I use a mixture of unsalted butter, plain flour, icing sugar (because this is sweet shortcrust!), and egg yolk. There is also a splash of water, but I don’t tend to list that because, well, it’s just water. 
        </p>
        <p class="recipefont">
            I find the pastry so easy to make by hand so you don’t need to use any machines – and it also means the pastry dough isn’t overworked which is quite nice. You just need to add the plain flour, cold and cubed unsalted butter and icing sugar to a bowl and rub together to form bread crumbs. 
        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img class="recipeimage" src="image/Tart/BakewellTart10-2.jpg" >
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <img class="recipeimage" src="image/Tart/BakewellTart4-2.jpg" >
        </div>
        <p class="recipefont">
            Then, you add in the egg yolk and the cold water to bind the pastry – I use my hands again here, along with a spatula, and then eventually after kneading in a bowl you will have a pastry. A little kneading on the lightly floured work surface and you will have a dreamily smooth shortcrust pastry. 
        </p>
        <p class="recipefont">
            Because you have worked the pastry you will need to let it chill again somewhat before using it. I tend to wrap the pastry in clingfilm and place it in the fridge for 30 minutes. In this time you can grease and flour a loose-bottomed 23cm/9” tart tin. 
        </p>
        <div class="center">
            <img class="recipeimage" src="image/Tart/BakewellTart9-2.jpg" >
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <img class="recipeimage" src="image/Tart/BakewellTart10-2.jpg" >
        </div>
        <p class="recipefont">
            Roll the chilled pastry out onto a lightly floured work surface until it’s about the thickness of 1-2 £1 coins. Carefully lift the pastry and press into the bottom and sides of the prepared tin really well. Get a piece of parchment paper, and place it on top of the pastry. Fill this with baking beans or uncooked rice and ‘blind’ bake the pastry for 15 minutes. 
        </p>
        <p class="recipefont">
            The blind baking process starts to bake the pastry so that there are no soggy bottoms – after the 15 minutes, you remove the parchment and beans and bake for a further 5 minutes to dry the pastry out a little more. Then, you can do the quick and easy filling. 
        </p>
        <div class="center">

        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <img class="recipeimage" src="image/Tart/BakewellTart5-2-500x500.jpg" >
        </div>
        <p class="recipefont">
            The filling is so simple – one layer is simply just jam. There is debate over which is the ‘classic’ flavour, but I tend to use raspberry. You can use whatever you prefer though! The rest is the ‘frangipane’ – which is melted butter, sugar, ground almonds, almond extract and egg. 
        </p>
        <p class="recipefont">
            I mix these together until smooth, pour over the jam – and then top with some flaked almonds. I bake until there is an ever so slight wobble in the middle of the tart and then let it cool fully. I then do a small drizzle of water icing, and sometimes some extra toasted flaked almonds. 
        </p>
        <p class="recipefont">
            I then absolutely devour this Bakewell tart because it’s just so good. You can serve it with custard, ice cream, cream or even just on its own – the flavour carries so well that you can do whatever you want! Honestly, it’s the best. Enjoy! X

                <li class="recipefont ">Add the flour and icing sugar to a large bowl. Add the cold and cubed unsalted butter and rub the mixture together with your fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li class="recipefont ">Add the egg yolk, and 1 tbsp of cold water into the bowl and mix with your hand or a spatula until the pastry dough comes together - it may take a bit of kneading.</li>
                <li class="recipefont ">Alternatively, add the ingredients to a food processor and blitz quickly on the pulse setting until the mixture starts to bind, it shouldn't take too long at all!</li>
                <li class="recipefont ">Grease & flour a 9"/23cm loose bottomed tart tin - Roll the pastry mix out onto a lightly floured surface to the thickness of 1-2 coin(s).</li>
                <li class="recipefont ">Press the pastry into the tin and trim & neaten the edges. Fill any gaps of the pastry with any excess pastry so its all covered! Refrigerate for 1/2 an hour!</li>
                <li class="recipefont ">Preheat the oven to 200ºc/180ºfan - Cover the pastry with baking parchment and fill with baking beans/rice and bake the pastry 'Blind' for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li class="recipefont ">After 15 minutes, remove the parchment and the beans and bake for an extra 5 minutes or until the pastry is cooked through and turning golden! </li>
                <li class="recipefont ">Once baked, leave to cool as you make the filling.</li>
